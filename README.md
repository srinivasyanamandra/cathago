- **Smart Analytics Dashboard** (Track scans, credits, and user activity)
- **Admin Panel** (Credit management, analytics, and user monitoring)
- **AI-powered document matching**
- **Automated Credit Reset** at midnight
- **User Activity Logs & Export Reports**
- **Multi-user Support** on a local server

## Credit System Implementation

### **Daily Free Credits:**
- Each user receives **20 free credits daily** (auto-reset at midnight).
- If a user **runs out of credits**, they must wait until the next day or request additional credits from an admin.

### **Admin Credit Management:**
- Users can request additional credits.
- Admins can **approve/deny requests** or **manually adjust balances**.

### **Handling Credit Deductions:**
- Each document scan deducts **1 credit**.
- Users with **0 credits cannot scan** unless:
  - They wait for the next daily reset, OR
  - Admin manually adds credits.
